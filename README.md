# Entra-Private-Access-Bootstraper

Portfolio rank: **21**

Automate a secure baseline for publishing legacy private applications through Entra Private Access.

## Architecture

IaC creates connector networks, hardened connector VMs, DNS dependencies, managed identities, Key Vault integration, application segments, and Entra access assignments. Conditional Access governs authenticated access without inbound exposure.

Primary services: `Entra Private Access`, `Virtual Machines`, `Private DNS`, `Key Vault`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

```

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 12 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See `docs/test-matrix.md` and `docs/runbook.md` before any integration trial.

## Community

See `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, and `LICENSE`. The reference
is intentionally conservative and uses synthetic identifiers only.

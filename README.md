# Entra-Private-Access-Bootstraper

Automate a secure baseline for publishing legacy private applications through Entra Private Access.

## Example synopsis

A legacy application request is converted into a guarded connector and private-access plan with tenant allow-listing, secretless administration, explicit production approval, and private DNS expectations.

## Real-world scenario

A company must expose an internal HR application to remote employees without opening inbound firewall ports or extending the corporate VPN. The bootstrapper places Entra identity and Conditional Access in front of the private application.

## Architecture

IaC creates connector networks, hardened connector VMs, DNS dependencies, managed identities, Key Vault integration, application segments, and Entra access assignments. Conditional Access governs authenticated access without inbound exposure.

Primary services: `Entra Private Access`, `Virtual Machines`, `Private DNS`, `Key Vault`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

```

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See [[`docs/test-matrix.md`](docs/test-matrix.md)](docs/test-matrix.md) and [[`docs/runbook.md`](docs/runbook.md)](docs/runbook.md) before any integration trial.
